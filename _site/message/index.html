<p>Hi. If you're viewing this then you either don't have JavaScript enabled or you're using such an old browser that it's not compatible with a lot of my website.</p>

<p>While I understand the importance of backwards compatibility and having a website that works without JavaScript, I use GitHub pages for my hosting. While GitHub is great, with better uptime than GoDaddy, great support, and an easy-to-use CLI, it only supports static HTML pages. This means that all my dynamic content really has to be done via JavaScript.</p>

<p>So, in order to have, say, my photo gallery work, I need JavaScript. All lazy loading and such is JavaScript. I try my best to make the website fast and as compatible as possible, but unfortunately a lot is out of my control.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>
