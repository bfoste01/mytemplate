  <h4 class="tborder">Western Vice-Chair for Washington College Republican Federation</h4>
  <p>November 2013 - present</p>
  <p>Recently elected to the executive board of the Washington College Republican Federation, my duties include my work at the PCCRs, as well as growing the College Republican clubs in Western Washington.</p>


 <h4 class="tborder">Vice-Chairman for Pierce County College Republicans</h4>
 <p>October 2013 – present</p>
 <p>Networked with various Washington state political organizations to increase the PCCRs' reach and influence.

<h4 class="tborder">Delivery Driver for Jimmy John’s</h4>
<p>September 2012 – present</p>
<p>I am working at Jimmy John's to pay for college without accruing debt. After one year of employment I had been taught nearly all non-managerial tasks. Working in the restaurant industry required me to be able to multi-task efficiently, and be able to switch from one task to another quickly, all while staying professional and providing excellent service.

<h4 class="tborder">Technical Field Specialist for Working Families</h4>
<p>June 2013 – August 2013</p>
<p>Hired on to help with the 2013 election cycle, my primary task was to collect voter identification data with Ground Game (v1.0 and v2.0). I sampled universes Working Families purchased from Moonshadow Mobile in Washington state's 26th Legislative District. In addition, I spent a great deal of time working with the developers at Moonshadow Mobile to fix the bugs plaguing Ground Game v2.0.
  

<h4 class="tborder">Deputy Field Coordinator for Hans Zeiger Campaign</h4>
<p>May 2012 – November 2012</p>
<p>I assisted with many field jobs, including doorbelling and literature drops. I accompanied the campaign staff to various political fundraising events, and I worked the GOP booth at the Pierce County Fair.  
  

<h4 class="tborder">Field Staffer for Enterprise Washington JobsPAC</h4>
<p>Fall of 2012</p>
<p>I organized door-to-door surveying and literature drops, collecting voter identification data in Washington state's 25th Legislative District. I managed a team, including planning our routes, keeping track of hours worked, houses reached, and reporting back to our supervisor.</p>
