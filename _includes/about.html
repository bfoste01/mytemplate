        <p>This is Eric Lagergren's blog template</p>
        <p>The About page is harder to replicate because it has a lot of Schema markup that won't necessarily be consistent with all the personal information you put on this page</p>
        <p>You can go to <a href="http://www.ericlagergren.com/about" target="_blank">my about page</a> and view the source to see what it looks like. It's a bit of a mess, but Schema isn't always super clean because it involves a lot of &lt;span&gt;s and whatnot.
        <p>This is about the only page that doesn't have much CSS to go along with it, so either do what I'm doing on this page with paragraph tags or just do whatever... it's up to you!</p>
