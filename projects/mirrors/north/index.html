                <p dir="ltr">To the highly valued employees of NORTH and our cherished creative and strategic partners:</p>
<p dir="ltr">As you probably know, one of the tv spots we created as part of last year’s campaign to drive enrollment in Oregon’s new ACA exchange was <a title="John Oliver: &quot;Oregon Spirit&quot; on Youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dh9munYYoqQ" target="_blank">brutally parodied by John Oliver</a> on the debut of his new HBO show this past Sunday. Images from our campaign have also recently accompanied scathing reports by MSNBC’s Chris Hayes, and pretty much every conservative blog in the known universe.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cg7fcgtt8hU" target="_blank"><img class="size-large wp-image-12860  alignnone" alt="Cover Oregon: Live Your Life" src="http://cdn.north.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Screenshot-2014-04-30-13.05.34-1024x561.png" width="640" height="350" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Now, you may think none of this is fair, given that we have had nothing whatsoever to do with the $200m+ dollars spent to build Cover Oregon’s online application portal.</p>
<p dir="ltr">You may also think it’s unfair to single out that particular tv spot from the many different ads we created, this one made specifically to connect with mothers, the primary drivers of health care decisions in the family, and always meant to be but one part of a much bigger whole that would reach all Oregonians, regardless of income, ethnicity or geography.</p>
<p dir="ltr">You may think it’s especially unjust because our work helped delivered the numbers: awareness of Cover Oregon through advertising increased nearly 70% in only four months prior to the first enrollment window in 2013. And on that first day of enrollment, a third of a million people came to the website to sign up. Had it been working, it’s a safe estimate we would have been more than half-way to enrollment goals within the first week. Relative to the marketing budget, along with the many efforts of the Cover Oregon marketing team, we created real return on taxpayer money.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVUJNEDpEkg" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-12861" alt="Cover Oregon: Live Long in Oregon" src="http://cdn.north.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Screenshot-2014-04-30-13.04.43-1024x566.png" width="640" height="353" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">It’s also never mentioned that as portal delays and bad press persisted, we hunkered down, responded with ads that were transparent, honest and informative. We worked especially hard with the Cover Oregon team to move people toward paper applications through agents and sign-up fairs.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Most importantly they fail to mention that, despite the broken portal, more than 250,000 Oregonians who previously had no access to health insurance were still able to shop for, apply for, and obtain coverage. Even with no online portal, Oregon is in the middle ranking for state enrollments. Remarkable, given the circumstances, and also a tribute to the tireless efforts of Cover Oregon&#8217;s communications and marketing staff.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny8fBJSTBNc" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-12859" alt="Cover Oregon: Healthcare for All" src="http://cdn.north.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Screenshot-2014-04-30-12.59.39-1024x564.png" width="640" height="352" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">So, is it fair?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Well, Mr. Oliver and others are quite right to expose and even parody the costs associated with the portal’s dysfunction. They’re also right to be angry at the damage potentially done to the ACA’s national momentum and to supportive politicians in the upcoming mid-terms. Unfortunately for us, our passionate, hard, honest work will forever be associated with a broken website. So no, that&#8217;s not necessarily fair, but it is how the world works.</p>
<p dir="ltr">More importantly, are we, as Mr. Oliver suggests, stupid fucking idiots?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Yes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Given the world today, you have to be a stupid fucking idiot to want to help activate a legislation so controversial.</p>
<p dir="ltr">You have to be a stupid fucking idiot to suggest a strategy that unites people around a common good before selling them on something as complicated as health insurance.</p>
<p dir="ltr">You have to be a stupid fucking idiot to think advertising can actually help improve the quality of people’s lives.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But at North, we welcome stupid fucking idiots. And I’d do it all again just the same, proudly.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Although, next time I’d probably leave the website out of the ads.</p>

I didn&#8217;t take the Oliver piece as making fun of your ads at all, other than calling them adorable (which obviously the one at issue was). But I guess it&#8217;s harder to make that distinction if it&#8217;s your own work being parodied.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-13330" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Your right sweeping generalities are not always that accurate.  They do get used in arguments, and in comedy quite a bit.  Just so&#8217;s you don&#8217;t get caught in the trap of these generalities, I would like to inform you that a vast amount of my personal sample of Oregonians thought these ads were awful.  I have also noted quite a few of the comments here repeat my sentiments.</p>
<p>I really don&#8217;t care about the personal artists involved, they were making art, and that is subjective.  They can handle critique and probably even parody.  Artists, in my experience, have thicker skins than that.</p>
<p>Now to my issue.  These ads and this ad agency is responsible for the quality of their work.  Their work was not good.  I think a very strong case can be made for their ad&#8217;s being uninformative, puerile, bombastic, and make this state, and residents such as my self seem like a joke.  I think my argument is backed up by quite a lot of evidence, if you read these comments you should get a clear picture of others that share my view.  </p>
<p>Your argument about my sweeping generalization is noted.  I still stand by it, as I am trying to make a point about this ad campaign being a waste of time and money, as well as the poster needing to be ashamed for what was produced, and hopefully humble him into taking responsibility for his actions.</p>
<p>I understand your desire to stick up for the artists involved in this, and even defend the whole pseudo-folk, twee, and cutesy genre.  But I just want to clarify I am going after the poster.  My generalizations are just for effect.</p>

You also clearly have no understanding how this kind of program implementation is executed. North didn&#8217;t have anything to do with the buildout of the website. They delivered on their obligation, which was to create a series of ads for the product. Blame the implementation vendor for mucking up the marketplace.</p>
<p>Also, Oregon&#8217;s been musically &#8220;weird&#8221; for a good couple of decades, if not longer. The Decemberists, the Dandy Warhols, Blitzen Trapper, the Helio Sequence&#8230;I could name others. Just because you didn&#8217;t like the style of this ad doesn&#8217;t mean it wasn&#8217;t effective.</p>

First, it was funny in the same raw way that Oliver&#8217;s skit was funny. 2nd, it illustrated, effectively, another point of view. Namely, people actually took a lot of pride in this work. It was more than a job, it was an ethos. 3rd, it provided some information. Interesting to note how many people actually showed up to signup right off the bat. Relative to other states.. Oregon pulled a ton of people out immediately. So, like the ad or not, the marketing had an effect. 4th, in line with point 2, it showed that the people who created this marketing strategy are actually passionate enough about it to defend it &#8212; most groups would take the $21 mil and run. I sure as hell haven&#8217;t heard from Oracle on this.. 5th, this letter and the followup posts in the coment section show a totally under-appreciated fact here. Who else is taking this kind of personal heat for this cock-up? Everyone seems to be happy to criticize and blame&#8230; but, why direct it toward the person responsible for getting the word out? By doing that, you&#8217;re really just proving the point in the letter. It&#8217;s easy to take aim at the most visible members of this project.. but, they&#8217;re not the ones who didn&#8217;t do their job. Franky, if you feel this passionate about the problem, you should be hunting down the project managers and CEO of Oracle&#8230;</p>

<p>I have a feeling that some thought went into their target audiences, after all there are 3 genre of music represented in the videos above.  I was exposed to all 3 of those, so I guess I had the opportunity to hear the message.  I listened to the songs, some were even catchy.  My main issue with the work of the agency is that they were selling a product that was discordant with the way they sold it, and the most important piece of the pie, the information on how to actually use this new product was completely absent from their ads.</p>
<p>So they fail.  Yet, they post this defense of some criticism leveled at them.  They actually have the balls to try to evade the blame for their failure, as well as the failure they are part of.  Why can&#8217;t they just admit that their campaign was not effective, actually contributed to the lack of people signing up (because people could not understand the messages their ads were supposed to convey).  Why can&#8217;t they &#8216;man up&#8217; and accept that they contributed to the overall failure of this product, and when someone makes fun of them, don&#8217;t get on the Internet to spew out your butt-hurt feelings at attacks on your creativity.  </p>
<p>Hey NORTH, your not that creative, your not good at making ads, and your promoting images that make a whole state look like fools.  Accept your failure.</p>

<p>At the same time, recognize that comedy shows frequently target locational stereotypes, and whether or not it was the fault of the people in Salem and Oracle (always blaming California, you guys!) or not, your stereotype is that you&#8217;re a bit loopier, cutesier, and more earnest than most other places.  At least you aren&#8217;t from a place where all you do is talk about traffic; worse yet, you could be from Florida!

If we want to blame the creative agency for getting paid to make an  ineffective ad (although in their defense they have some pretty solid engagement metrics), that’s fine, but you will find a lot more examples than just this ad to raise a furor over. $9m is a lot, $240M is much more. </p>
<p>The bottom line is that unfortunately the national conversation has been skewed by Oliver, pointing fingers at the wrong people, and ad agencies are easy fodder. It is Oracle, a company that likely already receives millions of dollars annually in state and federal tax breaks, along with a “handful of Salem policy wonks” with connections to Oracle lobbyists, that are to blame for charging the State of Oregon hundreds of millions of dollars for a product that doesn’t work. It is Oracle (based in California btw), not North who should be getting paraded around as a farce and focus of national humiliation.</p>

 I&#8217;m a writer / web producer with a grip of experience. I&#8217;m also an aging punk rock kid from Boston. I suggest you re-evaluate your reaction to the John Oliver thing.<br />
 Seriously, it&#8217;s just a joke. I know the parody leaned hard on hard work you guys did. But the punchline is $200 million on a website that doesn&#8217;t do the ONE thing it should. I live in Portland now. I saw your ads and thought they were fun and connected with an Oregon sensibility well; So did the guys from that show.<br />
 It made a perfect foil for the joke.<br />
 You guys are not stupid idiots and that&#8217;s not where they were going with it. Christ, you guys worked a great ad campaign for a busted product. How the hell would you know that? That would be like blaming whoever did the ads for the Corvair for massive trauma. Not fair.<br />
 Anyhow, I&#8217;m looking for work. I&#8217;ve done ad campaigns for Hollywood movies, through Real Pie Media, liquor, through Brown-Forman and all kinds of music, through BlankTV, Napster and YouTube.<br />
 I would love an interview.<br />

And everybody we met, both in passing and folks we had contacted beforehand, was very supportive of change in our country (queue the more sweeping passages in Mark&#8217;s original comments). </p>
<p>But one thing I really am thankful for is that I had the opportunity to meet people early in the morning for a calf branding and discuss health care change.

<p>Oregon has a 100-year political history of actually accomplishing things for its voters and citizens.  It&#8217;s weird that way.  The Cover Oregon debacle is a painful exception, remarkable, unusual, where in New Jersey or Phoenix or Chicago politics the deliberate waste of a quarter-billion of tax money is just another good day at the office.</p>

<p>You probably put a lot of well-intended thought and care into your work. Thanks for that. But as as the Chief Creative Officer of the company behind the image and voice of such a grand public service rollout, you might consider that Oregon &#8211; like many other states in this climate of declining public resources &#8211; is struggling to achieve even basic bureaucratic competence in its administration of public services. So, when Oregon blunders $250M on bad tech, it only adds insult to injury, and in this case likely did so quite literally. Real physical ailments. Real illness. It&#8217;s not like the line at the DMV simply got longer. </p>
<p>So, before you publicly judge someone&#8217;s sad story, and especially with some authority on the patent &#8220;tired working class sob story,&#8221; please understand that utter failures such as these might impact people in very real and emotional ways. People might not care about your perspective on marketing dollars. Be graceful when you can. And thanks for funding Portland&#8217;s creatives. </p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-13270" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I thought the point of the John Oliver thing was that Portland, as a whole, erred  towards focusing on cuteness, visual appeal and good advertising over an actual functioning system. I don&#8217;t think anyone was ever questioning the effectiveness of the ads. They were questioning the focus. He was saying that Portland is easily seduced, shallow and focused on the wrong things. Good feelings over being thorough. That seems like a fair critique of the overall issue. I can understand why you guys might be defensive. It&#8217;s obvious you put in a lot of work into that campaign. Parody, though, in this instance is (I think) an honor because parody generally goes after the most recognizable part of a subject. I don&#8217;t think the criticism was for the ads but that&#8217;s where the most effective communication and best delivered joke could be made because it was the most recognizable part. Advertising is always going to have this risk because anytime ANYTHING is ASKING for attention there is a chance that some of that attention will be critical or unfair or made into jokes. You&#8217;re not alone in town. Look at Sockeye&#8217;s Derrick Rose &#8220;The Return&#8221; campaign. Great and effective campaign that will be a joke forever, but it never would have become a joke if they hadn&#8217;t done their jobs well. So try and have a sense of humor about all this.</p>
